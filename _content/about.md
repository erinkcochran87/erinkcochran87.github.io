  **Imaginary Interviewer (II)**: What were your first thoughts about each other?

  **Erin**: I thought he was cute and funny - one of the few people I actually enjoyed getting messages from on OKCupid. He canceled on me twice before we finally went out, though. At that point, I was so sure he was a flake.

  **Seth**: I thought she was cute and snarkey. Her messages of OKC always had a little bit of a bite to them. But, I knew that she had to be pretty sweet in person with how proud she was of [her self-done watermelon nails](#gallery).

  **II**: Where did you go on your first date?

  **Seth**: We went to [Perch Pub](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-insider/Perch-Pub-to-close-ending-an-era-on-Broad-Street.html), in Center City Philly.

  **II**: The date clearly went well, since you're now getting married. Tell me what the date was like.

  **Erin**: I liked him immediately. All thoughts of flakiness disappeared. He told me about the time he almost fought a bear and I decided he was pretty awesome.

  **Seth**: Right after I told her that story, a large group of [drunken Santa Clauses mobbed the bar](http://runningofthesantas.com/santas/philadelphia/).

  **Erin**: The rest was history, as they say.
