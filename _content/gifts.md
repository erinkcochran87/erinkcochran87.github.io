  We mean it when we say that your joining us to celebrate our start into married weirdness is the best gift we could ask for.

  Really.

  If, however, you'd still like to get us a gift, you can use our [Honeyfund](). Honeyfund is a honeymoon registry that, should you choose to participate, would allow us to gallivant about Europe without a care in the world.

  We're lucky enough to already have a home full of everything we need, so please use this wishlist if you'd like to gift us with more than your presence. :)

  We love you, and we can't wait to celebrate with you!
